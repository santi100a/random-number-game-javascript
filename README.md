# Random Number Game in JavaScript 

This is a basic command-line based random numbers game, where you have
to guess the number. If it is wrong, then it gives you an error and
encourages you to try again; if you manage to guess the right number, 
then it cheers you on and asks you if you want to play again. If you 
answer 'y' then it continues; if you answer 'n', it exits; if you 
specify nothing or something invalid, then it defaults to 'y'.
