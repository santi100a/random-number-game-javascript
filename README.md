# Random Number Game in JavaScript

This is a basic command-line based random numbers game, where you have
to guess the number. If it is wrong, then it gives you an error and
encourages you to try again; if you manage to guess the right number,
then it cheers you on and asks you if you want to play again. If you
answer 'y' then it continues; if you answer 'n', it exits; if you
specify nothing or something invalid, then it defaults to 'y'.

To run this game, you'll have to:

- Clone this repo by running ```git clone https://github.com/santi100a/random-number-game-javascript.git```.
- Enter the directory and run ```node .```.
- Enjoy the game!
